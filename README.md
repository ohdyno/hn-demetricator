# Hacker News Demetricator

**[Download on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hacker-news-demetricator/dihffdmjkpohpejghlapggoiieifikeo)**

Remove upvote and comment counts from Hacker News.

Judge submissions by their merit, not by their upvote count.

Oftentimes, the amount of upvotes or comments a post has influences our opinion of it more than the actual content itself. This extension was made as part of an effort to judge social media posts by the merit of their content, and not by the number of other people that seem to like or agree with them. I've found that this has resulted in me reading articles more thoroughly before jumping into the comments and has exposed me to a wider variety of content than I would have clicked into otherwise. If you're interested in this kind of stuff, I'd recommend checking out [Twitter Demetricator](https://github.com/bengrosser/twitter-demetricator), made by Ben Grosser.

This extension is compatible with Hacker News Enhancement Suite.
